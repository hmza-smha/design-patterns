# 1. Creational Patterns
These deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

## âœ… Most Common:
### Singleton
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
### Factory Method
Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
### Abstract Factory
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
### Builder
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
